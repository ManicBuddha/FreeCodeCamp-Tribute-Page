    <h2 id="tribute-info">Three Years of Best Dog</h1>  
    <p>Three years ago I was able to pick up a three year old puggo who needed a home. What I didn't realize was how important the little creature would become in my life. </p>
    <p>Lilo was the sweetest dog anyone could ever ask for. On my good days and bad days she would constantly be in the same room so we were always together. One of the greatest aspects of her personality was of how calm she always was. She did get excited to meet new friends and family and do zoomies. However, most of the time she would just want to chill in the moment like a miniature Buddha. Lilo was an adventurer. Never faultering for being a barrel with legs she was always quick to go running with me or go on a hike! She loved going out on her daily walks and getting a little too close to birds and geese.</p>
     <p>She was one of the best cuddle buddies and was always game to snuggle up for a good nap! During the winter months, Lilo was a life saver because she acted like a little radiator and moved very little at night! Two of my favourite things about Lilo was her voractious appetite and her "boofs". Lilo could eat her dog bowl within 5 seconds-no lie. It was truly awe-inspiring to observe because she would be done before other dogs even had their first bite! Her "boofs" were her little barks. She wasn't a loud dog and instead of barking too much she preferred to go "boof". Only time she was a little loud was when she got excited and did her little howls. Her howls are some of my most fond memories of her. </p>
  <h2 id="disappearance">The Sadness</h2>
  <p> On March 16, 2020 around 1100 Lilo was let out to go potty in our yard. As of that time, that was the last time we saw her. She had no prior experience of escaping yards or running away. Due to covid-19 printing posters has been hard but we have made lost pet reports to places like PET FBI, Dayton Lost and Rescue page, as well as activating her microchip.
