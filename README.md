Third of fourth try to submit this WebDesign Certification Project from 
FreeCodeCamp via GitHub command line. 

Going to use this to track my progress with Git, command line, and the web 
design languages in the future. Also, CodePen only allows 1 project at a time 
so I'll just save all the projects via GitHub. Great Learning experiences!
